## MySetup NodeJS
![Badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=DH&message=DOSOMETHINGGREAT&color=0070f3&style=<0070f3>&logo=rocket)

### Description

This is my basic configuration of nodejs projects with express, using code patterns like ESLint, Prettier and EditorConfig.

### Techs

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/)

### Code Standards

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)

### Getting Started

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer
- [Node.js v14.16.0](https://nodejs.org/) or heigher.

Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.
- [Yarn v1.22.5](https://yarnpkg.com/) or heigher.

Also, it’s good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
